## Key Trends & Insights (2020-2025)

### 1. **E-Bike Safety Concerns Intensifying**
- **Highest fatality rate**: E-bikes at 1.2% vs 0.5% for traditional bikes
- **2025 projection alarming**: 2.3% fatality rate projected for 2025
- **Speed and infrastructure mismatch**: E-bike speeds (up to 25mph) exceed safe speeds for shared bike infrastructure

### 2. **Post-Pandemic Micromobility Boom**
- **Traditional bikes**: 31% growth from 2020-2025
- **E-bikes**: 106% growth in same period
- **Total micromobility casualties**: Nearly doubled since 2020

### 3. **E-Scooter Market Maturation**
- **Peak and decline**: Growth from 2020-2022, then stabilization/decline
- **Regulatory impact**: NYC's e-scooter pilot program regulation visible in data
- **Safety improvement**: Fatality rates trending down after initial volatility

### 4. **2025 Projections** (*based on 8 months of data*)
- **Traditional bikes**: 245 casualties (maintaining growth trend)
- **E-bikes**: 128 casualties (potential market saturation)
- **E-scooters**: 53 casualties (continued decline)

## Safety Risk Analysis

### Fatality Rate Comparison (2020-2025)
1. **E-Bikes**: 1.2% - **Most dangerous** micromobility option
2. **E-Scooters**: 0.7% - Moderate risk
3. **Traditional Bicycles**: 0.5% - **Safest** option

### Volume vs Risk Assessment

## Policy Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (2025)
1. **E-bike speed limits**: Implement 15mph limits in pedestrian zones
2. **Mandatory helmet enforcement**: Focus on e-bike operators
3. **Infrastructure auditing**: Assess bike lane capacity for mixed speeds
4. **Public awareness campaigns**: Highlight e-bike pedestrian safety risks

### Long-term Strategy (2025-2030)
1. **Separated e-bike infrastructure**: Dedicated lanes for different vehicle classes
2. **Technology requirements**: Speed governors, lights, better braking systems
3. **Operator licensing**: Consider e-bike registration/licensing programs
4. **Data-driven regulation**: Real-time monitoring of micromobility safety metrics

### Research Priorities
1. **Severity analysis**: Compare injury severity across micromobility types
2. **Infrastructure correlation**: Map casualties to infrastructure types
3. **Demographic analysis**: Understand operator and pedestrian demographics
4. **Speed studies**: Actual operating speeds vs. safety outcomes

## Data Quality Notes

- **Analysis Period**: 2020-2025 (focused on better data quality post-2020)
- **2025 Projection**: Based on 8 months of data, projected to full year (factor: 1.58x)
- **Data Source**: NYC Open Data Motor Vehicle Collisions
- **Total Bike-Involved Records**: 3,797 incidents (all years), 2,926 incidents (2020+)

### Why 2020+ Focus?
- Improved data collection and standardization
- Clear emergence of e-bike and e-scooter categories
- Post-pandemic mobility patterns more representative of current trends
- Better vehicle type classification consistency

## Conclusions

The data shows **e-bikes present a disproportionate safety risk** to pedestrians compared to traditional bicycles, with 2.4x higher fatality rates. While traditional bicycles cause more total casualties due to volume, the **individual risk profile of e-bikes requires immediate policy attention**.

**The projected 2025 e-bike fatality rate of 2.3% suggests the safety gap is widening**, making targeted interventions critical for pedestrian safety in NYC's evolving transportation landscape.
